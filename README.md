# Why?
So, i have got this cool Buzz!-controllers to be used with the PlayStation 2 quiz game series Buzz! I wondered wether i can use them to control OBS software for video streaming. With this software, it works!

# How?
This software translates the input from the Buzz!-controllers to keyboard input, more exaclty control-numpad0-9 and control-numkeys0-9 (20 buttons, 20 inputs). This ombinations can be used to register in obs software.

# What to do?
The .exe file in debug folder may be used to start control, but you have to copy the .dll file from HIDAPI-folder into the same folder as the .exe. No need for admin rights. The interface is simple, close window to exit program.
